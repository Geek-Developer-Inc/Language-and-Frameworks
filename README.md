#### Difference between C and C++

##### Similarities between C and C++ are: 
 
   -- Both the languages have a similar syntax.
   
   -- Code structure of both the languages are same.
   
   -- The compilation of both the languages is similar.
   
   -- They share the same basic syntax. Nearly all of C’s operators and keywords are also present in C++ and do the same thing.
   
   -- C++ has a slightly extended grammar than C, but the basic grammar is the same.
   
   -- Basic memory model of both is very close to the hardware.
   
   -- Same notions of stack, heap, file-scope and static variables are present in both the languages.
   
##### Differences between C and C++ are:

   C++ can be said a superset of C. Major added features in C++ are Object-Oriented Programming, Exception Handling and rich C++ Library. 

   Below is the table of differences between C and C++:  

#### C Programming Language

   The C programming language was originally developed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system by Dennis Ritchie. The C language, which is quite simple, is not tied to any particular hardware or system. This makes it easier for a user to write programs that will run without many (or any) changes on practically all machines.

   The C language is often called a middle-level computer language as it combines the elements of high-level languages with the functionalism of assembly language. C programming allows the manipulation of bits, bytes, and addresses—giving the programmer more control over exactly how the program will behave and more direct access to the mechanics of the underlying hardware.

   C was created, influenced, and field-tested by working programmers. The end result is that C gives the programmer what the programmer wants.

#### C++ Programming Language

   C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
   
   C++ is an enhanced version of the C language. C++ includes everything that’s part of C and adds support for object-oriented programming (OOP). In addition, C++ also contains many improvements and features that make it a “better C,” independent of object oriented programming.

   The C++ language is actually extensible since we can define new types in such a way that they act just like the predefined types which are part of the standard language.

   If you just use C++ as a better C, you will not be using all of its power. Like any quality tool, C++ must be used the way it was designed to be used to exploit its richness. Some of the new features include encapsulation, inline function calls, overloading operators, inheritance, and polymorphism.
